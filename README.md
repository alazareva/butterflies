This sketch uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/get-started/) library to generate a butterfly scene. You can modify the code to change the following:
* The number of butterflies
* Their size range
* How long they rest on top of the letters
* Update the text

To run the sketch locally you will have to start up a local http server. You can install a simple command-line server with npm

`npm install --global http-server`

or with Homebew

`brew install http-server`

Then run to start the server.

`http-server -c-1`
